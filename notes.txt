ng new devlogger
ng g c components/navbar --skipTests
ng g c components/log-form --skipTests
ng g c components/logs --skipTests
npm install bootstrap popper.js jquery font-awesome
Edited angular.json file to add styles and scripts - restarted server since it is required after editing angular.json
ngOnInit = lifecycle method, runs when components initialize
To generate service:
ng g s services/log --skipTests
(The --module or --save aren't needed as that functionality is provided in the log.service.ts file for A6+ with the code: 
"
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
"
)

When you bring in a service it has to be inject as a dependency into your constructor like so (logs.component.ts):
"
constructor(private logService: LogService) { }
"
